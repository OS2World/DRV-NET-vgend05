2.No Warranty

This code is provided 'AS IS' and any warranties are disclaimed.


3.Functional restrictions

- Wake-on-LAN is not supported.
- VLAN/Priority is not supported.


4.Considerable configuration keywords

- RXQUEUE keyword value should be multiple of 4.
- DAPOLL keyword seems to be meaningless.


5.Note

>> On my test environment, ASUS P5A + K6-2 500(300MHz) 
>> + KUROUTO SHIKOU GbE-PCI(VT6122), this driver is strongly unstable 
>> in giga bit ethernet mode:-) OS stalls easily... 
>> Probably the motherboard is out of order.

>Now I change test machine. NEC PC9821 Xa13 + Cyrix MII-400.
>It works stable... But I notice PHY trouble.
>In giga bit mode, link between 2 PHYs, local NIC's PHY and link partner's, 
>enters bad state. Frequently Activity. MAC side seems to be not retated 
>to this phenomenon. Trouble between PHYs. I don't find any resolution yet.

Now I change test card. OK.
Both test machine and test card were out of order:-)
